# Hookiller

(I might change the name)

The idea of this tool came to me after I came across an info stealer, disguised as a hacking software, that was made to trap script kiddies and steal (a lot) of informations.

## What can the tool do ?

- Send X message(s) to a webhook (with custom name and avatar)
- Flood a webhook with random messages
- Delete a webhook
